Quantum algorithm to find division property of a multiset

The C code implements Quantum algorithm to find division property of a given multiset.
<a href=https://quest.qtechtheory.org/>QuEST<a/> library is used to simulate quantum environment.

"quantumfind_k.c" contains the code to find division property of a multiset when each element in the multiset has "n=3"-bits.
"quantumfind_k_4bits.c" contains the code to find division property of a multiset given on page 6 of the paper "Structural evaluation by generalized integral property" by Y. Todo. Here, "n=4"-bits.

Usage: Run in command prompt "quantumfind_k.exe"
Usage: Run in command prompt "quantumfind_k_4bits.exe"
